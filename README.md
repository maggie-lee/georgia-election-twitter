# georgia-election-twitter
This is the code behind [GeorgiaElectionTwitter.com](http://www.georgiaelectiontwitter.com).

It's mostly Python & Flask, and is posted here to go with my portfolio, [MaggieLee.net](http://www.maggielee.net).

The live version is liable to be a little different. And I'll archive it after the 2020 election.
