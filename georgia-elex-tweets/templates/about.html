<div class="main">

        <p class="font-weight-bold">Who are you?</p>
        <p>I'm Maggie Lee, a freelance reporter who covers state and local government in Atlanta, Georgia. I do
            traditional written reporting and data reporting, and <a href="http://maggielee.net/" rel="noopener">I have a portfolio</a>.
            This is a side project.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">What is this?</p>
        <p>It's the tweets of the people running for U.S. House or U.S. Senate from Georgia in 2020 who tweet. There
        were already more than 60 candidates when this started as of late 2019, but not all are on Twitter.</p>
        <p>The data doesn't include retweets, because as we all know, those aren't endorsements!</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">Why are you doing this?</p>
        <p> I wanted to capture 2020 Georgia election rhetoric
            and throw it into a single convenient dumpster fire. I figured it would be nuts
            because we'll have two U.S. Senate races and we're supposed to now be a swing state instead of a quiet one-party state.</p>
            <p>But as I read the tweets, I realized the site could also capture and list policy statements.</p>
            <p>And it puts Democrats and Republicans on the same list, side-by-side, which removes the filter
            effect that you get if your social media tends to be full of one side or the other.</p>
            <p>So now this project has two purposes: come for the policy discussion and stay for the hate-reading/love-reading of the
                candidates you have feelings about.</p>
            <p>Also, it's inspired by the <a href="https://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/" rel="noopener">Trump Twitter Archive</a>.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">Who's on the list?</p>
        <p>The list is stored as this <a href="https://twitter.com/maggie_a_lee/lists/ga-elex" rel="noopener">Twitter list</a>.
            I'm going by candidates per <a href="https://elections.sos.ga.gov/GAElection/CandidateDetails" rel="noopener">filings with the Georgia Secretary of State's office</a>.

            Before those were due, I went by <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/candidates/?election_year=2020&state=GA&is_active_candidate=true" rel="noopener"> FEC filings</a>.
            <p>I'm looking up Twitter handles myself, and some of these folks change their handles. It's hard to keep a "handle" on it! ðŸ˜¹</p>
            <p>If I'm missing a handle, please let me know via <a href="https://twitter.com/maggie_a_lee" rel="noopener">@maggie_a_lee</a> on
            Twitter or at georgiaelectiontwitter@gmail.com.</p>
            <p>I remove candidates from the Twitter list when they drop out of the race, but their archived tweets will still be here.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">Who drew the icons?</p>
        <p>The Georgia icon is by <a href="https://thenounproject.com/leonardo.schneider/collection/georgia/?i=101696" rel="noopener">Leonardo Schneider</a>.</p>
        <p>The ballot box is by <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=ballot%20box&i=117646" rel="noopener">Josh</a>.</p>
        <p>Both are licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/legalcode" rel="noopener">Creative Commons</a> and collected at <a href="https://thenounproject.com" rel="noopener">The Noun Project</a>.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">How did you get this data?</p>
        <p>I wrote a script in Python that downloads tweets about every 15 minutes and saves them to a database.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">Can I use this data?</p>
        <p>Yes. It is <a href="https://ga-elex-twitter-sx7bcyrkda-ue.a.run.app/simplified_output/elex_tweets?_sort_desc=created_at_est" rel="noopener">here</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette" rel="noopener">Datasette</a>.
            You can explore the data without downloading it. Or you can download it. Or it has an API. Up to you.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">How far back do these tweets go?</p>
        <p>About August 20, 2019 for candidates who had filed paperwork by that time. When new candidates file paperwork,
            I'll add them, but their archives won't go back so far.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">Do you have deleted tweets?</p>
        <p>Sometimes! The bot searches for tweets about every 15 minutes. So if a tweet is made and deleted very quickly, the
         bot won't find it. But if a tweet is made then deleted more than about 15 minutes later, yes, the deleted tweet will be here.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">Are the times right?</p>
        <p>Most likely, but it assumes the tweet-er was in the Eastern time zone. Twitter stores tweets in Coordinated Universal Time, which is four hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time.
            I converted all times to EST, but ... if the tweet-er was in a different time zone when they tweeted, the time may be off. When in doubt, go back to the original tweet.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">Will this ever end?</p>
        <p>Truly, it feels like election season is never over, but I'm going to shut this down and archive it after the
            2020 election.</p>
